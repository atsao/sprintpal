# Contributing

----RMP-----
[1-3 same as the flow we're used to, you'll only have to do these once]
1. Fork the official remote repo 
    (in Github in your browser)
2. Clone your new repo to your computer 
    git clone http://rmpardee/... greenfield

3. Add the official repo as an upstream so you can pull from it later
    git remote add upstream http://centillion/...


[4-7 we'll be repeating with each feature]
4. Make a new branch to work on whatever you're working on. Don't work directly on master
    git checkout master
    --> make sure you start on the master branch so that your new branch is based on that and not on a different branch
    
    git checkout -b myFeatureBranch
    --> this creates the new branch called myFeatureBranch and the -b then moves you to that new branch.

    [likely some time will pass here while you're working on this feature. You will be making frequent commits and push to the same branch on your origin remote repo with git push origin myFeatureBranch]

5. When you're ready to deploy the feature, make sure your master branch is up-to-date with the official repo's master branch
    git checkout myFeatureBranch
    --> make sure you're on your feature branch first

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    --> rebase the branch you're on onto whatever is on the upstream's master branch (the changes other team members have made since the last time you did this)

6. On Github's site in your browser, submit a pull request from your origin remote repo's feature branch to the official repo's master branch.
--> Other team members should review any pull requests and be merging them in. You should NOT merge your own pull requests, you should only merge other team members'.

7. Once your feature's been merged by someone else, back in your local repo, go to your master branch and update it with what's currently on the upstream's master.
    git checkout master

    git pull upstream master
    --> (for some reason adding --rebase here seems to make it not work, so just do a regular pull)
    --> Your master should now match the official repo's master. 

    git push origin master
    --> Bring your origin remote repo's master up-to-date

  You will now repeat #4-7 on your next feature, and the newFeatureBranch will be left behind and not ever updated again.




## Further notes:

Name branches thusly, and always cut them from master:
  - bug-...
  - feat-...
  - test-...
  - doc-...
  - refactor-...
Prefix each commit like so:
  - (feat) Added a new feature
  - (fix) Fixed inconsistent tests [Fixes #0]
  - (refactor) ...
  - (cleanup) ...
  - (test) ...
  - (doc) ...


#### Commit Message Guidelines

- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the
  commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max. Remember: This is a summary,
  not a detailed description of everything that changed.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should
  be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be
  as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.


### Making a pull request

Make a clear pull request from your fork and branch to the upstream master
branch, detailing exactly what changes you made and what feature this
should add. The clearer your pull request is the faster you can get
your changes incorporated into this repo.

Put a message in our Slack channel once you've done the pull request. Whoever sees it first should respond on Slack saying they're taking a look. That person will then give your changes a code review, and once they are satisfied they will merge your changes into upstream. **You will never be merging your own pull requests, someone else always will for you.**

If you're reviewing someone else's changes and think it isn't ready to merge, have a conversation with the person who submitted the pull request in our Slack channel. That person can then make more commits to their branch to fix these, then follow this process again from rebasing onwards.

Once it's good to go, merge it, and put a note in Slack again when you've merged. The Scrum Master will adjust the status of the issue on waffle.io.


### Details on rebase upstream changes into your branch - from the original template

Once you are done making changes, you can begin the process of getting
your code merged into the main repo. Step 1 is to rebase upstream
changes to the master branch into yours by running this command
from your branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

This will start the rebase process. You must commit all of your changes
before doing this. If there are no conflicts, this should just roll all
of your changes back on top of the changes from upstream, leading to a
nice, clean, linear commit history.

If there are conflicting changes, git will start yelling at you part way
through the rebasing process. Git will pause rebasing to allow you to sort
out the conflicts. You do this the same way you solve merge conflicts,
by checking all of the files git says have been changed in both histories
and picking the versions you want. Be aware that these changes will show
up in your pull request, so try and incorporate upstream changes as much
as possible.

You pick a file by `git add`ing it - you do not make commits during a
rebase.

Once you are done fixing conflicts for a specific commit, run:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

This will continue the rebasing process. Once you are done fixing all
conflicts you should run the existing tests to make sure you didnâ€™t break
anything, then run your new tests (there are new tests, right?) and
make sure they work also.

If rebasing broke anything, fix it, then repeat the above process until
you get here again and nothing is broken and all the tests pass.
