There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Group decisions simply made.

## Summary ##
  > Help groups come to concensus on what activity to do (what movie to see, what restaurant to go to, etc.)

## Problem ##
  > No one voices their opinion when gathered in a group.
    > You therefore never know how people feel about any particular option.
  > Way to make sure all participants opinions are heard/weighed.
  > Prevent one loud-spoken group member decide for everyone.

## Solution ##
  > Anonymity.
    > Utilize that nowadays everyone has a personal device in their pocket, which can be used to vote anonymously as you couldn't before.
  > We do all the tallying and decision-making for you.

## Quote from You ##
  > "You and your friends are hanging out together and need to decide what movie to watch. You have a few ideas, but no one speaks out to say which they prefer, or one strong-willed person overrules the quieter folks. With Dcydr, let everyone anonymously vote for their favorite, and we'll show you the group's decision. Hear everyone's voice, and simply decide."

## How to Get Started ##
  > The organizer simply goes to our website and sets up the decision to be made: puts in the options and the number of people who will be voting. Each participant then goes to the site and can easily vote for their preference. The results are tallied once everyone has voted and displayed.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I love knowing with confidence each and every time that everyone's excited about the movie or restaurant we choose as a group. Super easy and fun to use."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Never feel like you're herding cats again. Next time you face a group situation with indecision, use Dcydr to decide in a snap.
